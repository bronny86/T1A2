# Bronny's Portfolio Website (T1A2)

## Purpose and Target Audience:

The purpose of this website is to showcase my skills and abilities as an aspiring web developer for an audience of potential employers for work opportunities and fellow developers for networking purposes.

Although the 'Projects' and 'Blog' sections are currently made up of place-holder text and images, I plan to update the website with my actual work as I continue through my coding bootcamp course.

## Functionality and Features:

I went into the design process with accessibility at the front of my mind, researching accessible color palettes on (https://venngage.com) and the most accessible fonts which is what lead to my choosing the font 'Poppins'from Google Fonts and a color palette featuring contrasting colors.

### Nav Bar -

Appears as the header on every page and provides links to all other main pages, each button changes color when hovered over

### Back To Top Button

Just above the footer on all pages, clicking this button takes you back to the top of the current page to save the user having to scroll all the way back to the top.

### Footer With Social Media Links

Appears on every page as the footer with icons that link to my LinkedIn profile, GitHub profile and an option to send me an email.

### Contact Me Form

Working 'Contact Me' form with inputs for first name, last name and a space to write a message. Clicking the 'Submit' button sends the content to my email address.

### Flip Cards

I don't have any actual projects to add yet so instead I made Flip Cards that currently show an image on the front and then when hovered over they flip to show 'Coming Soon' on the other side but I plan to update these with actual projects when I have them. This page utilises a media queary so that on desktop it will show the cards next to each other in a row format, while on mobile view the cards appear underneath each other in a column format.

### Blog Preview Cards

These preview cards show the blog post title, date published, a smaller version of the image in the post along with a short amount of text and a 'Read More' button with a hover effect that changes color and that when clicked, takes the user to the individual page for that blog post. Each card has a 3D shadow effect to make the cards stand out. This page utilises a media queary so that on desktop view the preview cards appear next to each other in a row  format, while on mobile the cards appear  underneath each other in a column format.

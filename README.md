# Bronny's Portfolio Website (T1A2)

## Purpose and Target Audience:

The purpose of this website is to showcase my skills and abilities as an aspiring web developer for an audience of potential employers for work opportunities and fellow developers for networking purposes.

Although the 'Projects' and 'Blog' sections are currently made up of place-holder text and images, I plan to update the website with my actual work as I continue through my coding bootcamp course.

## Functionality and Features:

I went into the design process with accessibility at the front of my mind, researching accessible color palettes on (https://venngage.com) and the most accessible fonts which is what lead to my choosing the font 'Poppins'from Google Fonts and a color palette featuring contrasting colors.
